      <description>Recently I&#39;ve been trying to train a neural network for machine translation (nematus) using the linux machine of the laboratory via ssh shell. But it keeps annoying me that each time I close the ssh connection, the training process terminates. As the training process is initiated from ssh shell, it is a child process that will be terminates when the parent process terminates (I exit the ssh shell).
The recommended way is to use screen, which it can create processes in different process groups, thereby keep the processes running even if you disconnect from ssh session.</description>
